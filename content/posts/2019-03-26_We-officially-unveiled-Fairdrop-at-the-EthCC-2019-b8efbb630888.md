On March 7 we wrapped up [another EthCC](https://blog.datafund.net/personal-data-privacy-and-ethics-in-a-decentralised-world-an-ethcc-talk-acc4ca2c5368) in Paris. The event once again proved to be one of the most interesting and productive blockchain conferences in Europe and beyond. And that is exactly the reason why we chose it as the perfect event at which to [**unveil Fair Data Society’s first blockchain product, Fairdrop**](https://blog.datafund.net/fairdrop-secure-private-unstoppable-file-transfer-for-the-free-world-f1a39adbdeab).

Along with Fairdrop we also released the accompanying [**fds.js**](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fds.js) library on GitHub, our open-source Serverless App Toolkit. It proved to be such a powerful tool that with it our CTO, Tadej Fius, built a completely decentralised chat application, Chattie, in just a couple of days!

But the really great thing about this library is that it represents the foundation for a personalised data storage. That’s because both Fairdrop and Chattie use the same storage layer to store their data, so you can access Fairdrop data from Chattie and vice versa! Think of it this way: it’s like reading your emails through your chat application, regardless which (combination of) chat and email applications you use.

### Fair Data Society went public

[**In his talk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsU5rTRPWws), Gregor Žavcer also introduced the concept of [**Fair Data Society**](https://blog.datafund.net/join-us-in-building-a-fair-data-society-6e096cac81ac) — a data-driven society based on technology that focuses on humans and their rights. A few projects immediately connected to the concept and we’re very glad to see that the idea of building a new data economy paradigm has intrigued other people as well. Stay tuned for updates.
